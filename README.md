## My Goal
The AI programmer should be able to pass the qualification test for companies and certificates. With a complete solid backbone of this technology, the final goal will be to create a profitable platform to start a startup, providing the service using the AI programmer.

* ### Why am I doing this?
By developing an anatomy of an AI programmer app, we can develop an environment where standalone developers to large businesses to develop thieir product with low cost and time efficiently. This project will center around the development of the product using the new “original” method, developed using the basic back propagation algorithms. The goal of the whole project will be to reach the ability to surpass a human senior web developer and system engineer in both terms of “encoding” and “deciphering”. 
* ### How is this project proceeding?
This project will mainly proceed through the following experimental categories: encoding, deciphering, and hacking. When experiments show that the focused experimental category has been exceeded, the project will proceed to the next category in the order: encoding, deciphering, and hacking.
